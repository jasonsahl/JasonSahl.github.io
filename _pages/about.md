### Overview

My lab is located in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA, at 7000ft (2137m) above sea level. In my group, we incorporate both wet
lab techniques and bioninformatics methods to better understand pathogen ecology, antimicrobial resistance, and 
pathogenesis. A list of current projects ongoing in the laboratory include:

1. **Antimicrobial resistance mechanism identification in Acinetobacter baumannii**.
2. **Characterization of Escherichia coli in Urinary Tract Infections**.
3.

### Software

My lab has developed or helped in the development of the following software applications:

1. Phylomark. A method to identify phylogenetic markers from whole genome alignments. Although originally designed
for whole genome
